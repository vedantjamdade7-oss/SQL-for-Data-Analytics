SQL Keywords & Functions
  Introduction

These SQL keywords and functions help in modifying query results, filtering data, and working with date values.

-- 1️⃣ Aliasing (AS)

Aliasing means giving an alternate (temporary) name to a column or table in the result.

It improves readability of the output.

Example:
SELECT name AS employee_name
FROM employees;

You can also alias tables:

SELECT e.name
FROM employees AS e;

-- 2️⃣ DISTINCT

DISTINCT is used to return only unique values from a column.

It removes duplicate values.

Example:
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;

-- 3️⃣ ORDER BY

 ORDER BY is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns.

  a) ASC (Ascending Order)

Default sorting order

Arranges data from A to Z

For numbers → smallest to largest

Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY name ASC;

 Sorts employee names from A to Z.

  b) DESC (Descending Order)

Arranges data from Z to A

For numbers → largest to smallest

Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;

 Sorts salary from highest to lowest.


-- 4️⃣ LIMIT

LIMIT is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query.

Example:
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 5;

# Returns only first 5 rows.

-- 5️⃣ OFFSET

OFFSET is used to skip a specific number of rows before returning results.
