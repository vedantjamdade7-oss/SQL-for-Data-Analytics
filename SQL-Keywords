  b) DESC (Descending Order)

-- 6️⃣ WHERE

EXAMPLE:-

USE market_star_schema;

SELECT * FROM market_fact_full
ORDER BY sales;

SELECT * FROM cust_dimen
ORDER BY city ASC;

SELECT * FROM orders_dimen
ORDER BY order_date ASC;

SELECT * FROM market_fact_full
ORDER BY cust_id ASC, sales DESC;

-- find the highest sales amount order
SELECT * FROM market_fact_full
ORDER BY sales DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- find the order with second highest sales amount
SELECT * FROM market_fact_full
ORDER BY sales DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
